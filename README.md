# Journey for the RISC-V- Program  

Welcome! This repository documents my progress and key takeaways as I participate in the **VLSI System Design (VSD) RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC) Tapeout Program**.  
My objective is to record each phase of the journey ‚Äî from digital logic design all the way to the final physical layout.  

This rigorous program offers hands-on experience in building a complete SoC, moving from a Register Transfer Level (RTL) description to the **GDSII** file format required for chip fabrication.  
As part of a national initiative, it harnesses **open-source EDA tools** to enable students and engineers to actively contribute to India‚Äôs expanding semiconductor ecosystem.

## üìÖ Week 0: Foundations & Tool Setup  

The initial week centered on creating a reliable development environment by installing and verifying the essential open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools.  

| Task | Core Tools Installed | Status |
|------|----------------------|--------|
| 0 | Icarus Verilog (Simulation), Yosys (Synthesis), GTKWave (Waveform Viewer) | ‚úÖ |

üìù **Installation Guide**:  
A full, step-by-step tutorial for installing and configuring these tools is available in the *Week 0* folder README.  

### üåü Highlights from This Stage  

- Hands-on practice configuring a Linux environment for digital design.  
- Built a foundational understanding of how each tool fits into the RTL-to-GDSII flow.  
- Compiled and simulated a test Verilog module to confirm that the toolchain works correctly.
